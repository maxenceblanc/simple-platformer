## About <a name = "about"></a>

The project was started for a neurosciences university project, I used a very simplified version of my platformer library. 

It is now very speedrun oriented. You can easily create your own levels, each one in a `levels.py` file.

`simple-platformer` features: 
* Simple physics and collisions
* Pseudo random level generation using a chunk library
* A timer with checkpoints. 
* Score calculation and saving.
